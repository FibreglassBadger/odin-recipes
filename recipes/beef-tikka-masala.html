    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is a recipe from the old age English-Indian cuisine which for decades has been the staple food for many of night owls and Saturday night takeaway goers. Mostly eaten by those who are inebriated but can also be enjoyed by the sober a like. If its not all down your pretty shirt in addition to all over your mouth by the  time you are half way through the meal, then you are not eating it right.
