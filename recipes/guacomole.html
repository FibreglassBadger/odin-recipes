<h2>Description</h2>
Whats better than a recipe that allows you smash all your Ingredients into a bowl over and over again? Well one that ! produces such an amazing taste sensation I'd say! From the Hispanics to the Latinos, almost everyone from across the globe has probably heard of this timeless mush, and now you can hopefully make it in your kitchen.

<p><h3>Ingredients</h3></p>

<ul>
    <li>1 large ripe tomato</li>
    <li>3 avocados, very ripe but not bruised</li>
    <li>juice 1 large lime</li>
    <li>handful coriander, leaves and stalks chopped, plus a few leaves, roughly chopped, to serve</li>
    <li>1 small red onion, finely chopped</li>
    <li>1 chilli, red or green, deseeded and finely chopped</li>
    <li>tortilla chips, to serve</li>
</ul>
<p><h3>Instructions</h3></p>
<ol>
    <li>Use a large knife to pulverise 1 large ripe tomato to a pulp on a board, then tip into a bowl.</li>
    <li>Halve and stone the 3 avocados (saving a stone) and use a spoon to scoop out the flesh into the bowl with the tomato.</li>
    <li>Tip the juice of 1 large lime, a handful of roughly chopped coriander, 1 finely chopped small red onion and 1 deseeded and finely chopped red or green chilli into the bowl, then season with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Use a whisk to roughly mash everything together. If not serving straight away, sit a stone in the guacamole (this helps to stop it going brown), cover with cling film and chill until needed.</li>
