Odin-recipes
This is my first project that the Odin Project has given me to complete. The task is to compile a few pages of recipes to form a website which will show that I can create a site that has multiple pages with basic navigation in the form of text hyper links. I will also show that I can create lists and paragraphs using just VS code text editor.

I learnt that it is very important to spell check everything, code can soon become bugged once a single letter or number is misplaced.
